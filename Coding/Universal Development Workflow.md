# 🎯 DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW PROTOCOL

## 🛑 MANDATORY CONSTRAINTS:

- **NEVER CODE WITHOUT PLAN APPROVAL**
- **STOP AFTER EACH COMPONENT**
- **WAIT FOR "done" CONFIRMATION**
- **NO BATCH IMPLEMENTATIONS**

## 📝 EXECUTION PATTERN:

### **Phase 1: Analysis & Planning**

- 🔍 Analyze existing codebase thoroughly
- 📋 Create detailed implementation plan
- 🎯 List all files to create/modify
- 📊 Present plan with clear deliverables
- **→ STOP → Wait for "done" confirmation**

### **Phase 2: Step-by-Step Implementation**

Step 1: [Component/Feature Name]
→ Code implementation
→ STOP → Wait for "done" confirmation
Step 2: [Component/Feature Name]
→ Code implementation
→ STOP → Wait for "done" confirmation
Step 3: [Component/Feature Name]
→ Code implementation
→ STOP → Wait for "done" confirmation
... Continue pattern until completion ...

### **Phase 3: Testing & Documentation**

- 🧪 Testing guidelines
- 📚 Usage documentation
- **→ STOP → Wait for final approval**

## ✅ USER CONFIRMATION COMMANDS:

- **"done"** → Continue to next step
- **"issues: [description]"** → Fix issues first
- **"test"** → Provide testing guidelines
- **"skip"** → Move ahead (with warnings)

## 🎯 QUALITY STANDARDS:

- Clean, documented code
- Error handling & loading states
- Mobile responsive
- Performance optimized
- No breaking changes
