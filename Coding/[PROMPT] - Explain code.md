Define the given project clearly and provide a detailed explanation of the associated code.

When defining the project, include its purpose, main functionality, and overall scope. Then, explain the code thoroughly by describing the key components, their roles, and how they interact to achieve the project's objectives.

# Steps

1. Present a concise project definition highlighting its goals and functionality.
2. Break down the code into meaningful sections or components.
3. For each section, describe what it does and how it contributes to the overall project.
4. Explain any important functions, classes, or algorithms with clarity.
5. Clarify how different parts of the code interact with each other.
6. Use clear, simple language suitable for readers who may not be experts in the domain.

# Output Format

- Start with a "Project Definition" heading followed by a summary.
- Follow with a "Code Explanation" heading.
- Under the code explanation, use subheadings or numbered points for different components.
- Provide explanations in paragraph form or bullet points as appropriate.

# Examples
