Define the purpose of the project clearly and succinctly, describing its main objectives and intended outcomes.

Then, provide a detailed, step-by-step guide on how to run the project. Each step should be clear and actionable, assuming the reader has basic relevant knowledge.

# Steps

2. Break down the process into sequential steps.
3. For each step, explain what needs to be done, including any prerequisites or tools required.

# Output Format

Respond with two sections:

1. **Project Purpose:** a concise paragraph summarizing the project's aim.
2. **Step-by-Step Guide:** a numbered list with clear instructions to run the project.

# Example
